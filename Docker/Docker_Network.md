## Docker Network Concepts

Docker networking enables containers to communicate with each other, the Docker host, and external networks. Understanding Docker's networking options is crucial for designing secure, scalable, and efficient containerized applications.

### **Key Docker Network Drivers**

| Driver    | Description                                                                                               |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| bridge    | Default network; connects containers on the same host and isolates them from others.                      |
| host      | Removes network isolation; containers share the host’s network stack.                                     |
| none      | No network connectivity except loopback; isolates container from all networks.                            |
| overlay   | Connects containers across multiple Docker hosts (multi-host networking).                                 |
| ipvlan    | Assigns IP addresses directly to containers for more control and VLAN support.                            |
| macvlan   | Assigns unique MAC addresses to containers, making them appear as physical devices on the network.        |

### **1. Bridge Network**

- **Default network driver** for standalone containers.
- Containers on the same bridge network can communicate with each other but are isolated from containers on other networks.
- Each container gets an IP address in the bridge subnet.
- Suitable for communication between containers on a single Docker host.
- **User-defined bridge networks** allow containers to communicate using container names (DNS resolution), unlike the default bridge which requires IP addresses or legacy linking[1][2][5][6].

**Example:**
```
docker network create -d bridge my-net
docker run --network=my-net -itd --name=container3 busybox
```
---

### **2. Host Network**

- Removes network isolation between the container and the host.
- Container uses the host’s IP address and ports directly.
- Useful for performance-critical applications but sacrifices isolation and security[1][5][6].

**Example:**
``` docker network create -d overlay --attachable my-attachable-overlay ```
---

### **5. Macvlan Network**

- Assigns a unique MAC address to each container, making it appear as a physical device on the network.
- Allows containers to be directly accessible on the local network (LAN).
- Useful for legacy applications or when containers need to be treated as separate devices.
- Requires a dedicated physical network interface and is only supported on Linux hosts[1][4][5].

---

### **6. IPvlan Network**

- Provides granular control over IP addressing and VLAN tagging for containers.
- Useful when integrating containers with existing physical networks and for improved network performance[1][5].

---

### **User-Defined Networks**

- Custom networks you create for your applications.
- Allow containers to communicate by name (DNS), improving service discovery and security.
- Recommended over the default bridge for production use[1][2][5][6].

### **Inspecting and Managing Networks**

- **List networks:**  
  `docker network ls`
- **Inspect a network:**  
  `docker network inspect <network_name>`
- **Connect a running container to a network:**  
  `docker network connect <network_name> <container_name>`
- **Disconnect a container from a network:**  
  `docker network disconnect <network_name> <container_name>`

### **Summary Table**

| Network Type | Scope           | Communication                  | Use Case                                   |
|--------------|-----------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| bridge       | Single host     | Containers on same host        | Default, local development                 |
| host         | Single host     | Shares host network            | Performance-critical, needs host ports     |
| none         | Single host     | No communication               | Maximum isolation                          |
| overlay      | Multi-host      | Across Docker hosts            | Swarm, distributed applications            |
| macvlan      | Physical LAN    | Appears as physical device     | Legacy/monitoring apps, direct LAN access  |
| ipvlan       | Physical LAN    | VLAN/IP control                | Advanced network segmentation              |
