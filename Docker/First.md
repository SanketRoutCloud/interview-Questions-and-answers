## Common Docker Interview Questions and Answers for Freshers

Below are frequently asked Docker interview questions for freshers, along with concise and clear answers to help you prepare.

---

**1. What is Docker?**

Docker is an open-source platform that enables developers to automate the deployment of applications inside lightweight, portable containers. These containers package the application code along with its dependencies, ensuring consistency across different environments.

---

**2. What are the main components of Docker?**

Docker has three main components:
- **Docker Client:** The interface through which users interact with Docker.
- **Docker Host:** Runs the Docker daemon and manages containers and images.
- **Docker Registry:** Stores Docker images, with Docker Hub being the most popular public registry.

---

**3. What is a Docker container?**

A Docker container is a standard, lightweight, and executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software: application code, libraries, system tools, and settings. Containers ensure the application runs the same regardless of the environment.

---

**4. What is a Docker image?**

A Docker image is a read-only template used to create containers. It contains the application code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies required to run the application. Images are stored in registries and can be shared or reused.

---

**5. What is a Dockerfile?**

A Dockerfile is a text file containing instructions for building a Docker image. Each instruction in the Dockerfile creates a layer in the image, such as copying files, installing dependencies, or setting environment variables.

---

**6. How do you create a Docker container?**

You can create a Docker container using the command:
``` docker container create <image_name> ```
This creates a new container from the specified image without starting it immediately.

---

**7. What is the difference between Docker and a virtual machine (VM)?**

- **Docker containers** share the host OS kernel, making them lightweight and fast to start.
- **Virtual machines** run a full operating system with its own kernel, making them heavier and slower to boot.

---

**8. What is a Docker registry?**

A Docker registry is a storage and distribution system for Docker images. Public registries like Docker Hub allow users to share images, while private registries can be used within organizations for secure image storage.

---

**9. What command lists all running Docker containers?**

``` docker ps ```
This command shows all currently running containers.

---

**10. How do you stop a running Docker container?**

``` docker stop <container_name_or_id> ```
This command stops a running container gracefully.

---

**11. What is the command to run an image as a container?**

``` docker run <image_name> ```
This command creates and starts a new container from the specified image.

---

**12. What are Docker volumes?**

Docker volumes are used for persistent data storage. They allow data to be shared among containers and persist even when containers are removed. Volumes can be managed using Docker CLI commands.

---

**13. What is Docker Compose?**

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications using a YAML file. It allows you to configure and start multiple containers with a single command.

---

**14. What are the advantages of using Docker?**

- Simplifies application deployment and scaling
- Ensures consistency across environments
- Efficient resource utilization
- Fast startup times for containers

---

**15. What are some limitations or drawbacks of Docker?**

- Limited storage options
- Basic monitoring capabilities
- No built-in automatic rescheduling of inactive nodes
- Complex setup for large-scale horizontal scaling
